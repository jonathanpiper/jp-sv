This particular trio has performed twice, [in 2024 on the Sound Praxis series](https://soundpraxis.org/events/2024-09-05) and here in 2025. We first met early in 2024 when [Nick Lesley](https://www.nicklesley.com/) and I joined a bill that included the duo of [Stevie Richards](https://www.instagram.com/noiseelectronique/) and [Nathan Hubbard](https://nathanhubbard.bandcamp.com/music) (and, as it happens, a duo featuring [Ryan Ebaugh](https://www.instagram.com/ryan.ebaugh/) with whom I now play as [1515](/music/2025-07-25-1515-1515)). Stevie had the idea to play a trio set with me and Nick, and it was good enough that we decided to try it again.
