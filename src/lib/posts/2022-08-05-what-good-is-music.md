**Opened:** 21 June, 2022

**Closed:** February, 2023

**Purpose:** To encourage visitors to consider the many roles that music can play in their lives, in their communities, and in the world at large through a series of provocative questions.

**Content:** Three primary questions: "What good is music for me?", "What good is music for us?", and "What good is music for the world?". Each question is accompanied by a contextualizing statment, e.g. about how music can be used in daily life for positive outcomes or how music can connect groups of people with external activities or sentiments.

**Setting:** Each question is presented as an intuitive interactive opportunity: placing balls in buckets to indicate an answer, threading paracord around pegs to complete a statement, and writing a freeform response on supplied cards. A child-oriented area asks younger viistors to illustrate how music makes them feel with colored pencils on magnetic tiles that can be taken home or placed on a magnetic board to form a collage.

**Roles:** Conception, script writing, interaction design, fabrication, installation.
