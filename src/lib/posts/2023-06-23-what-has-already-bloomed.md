caption: 'improvisation with tuba, pie tin, jingle bells, and electronics'
---
An improvisation performed at [Space 4 Art](https://www.sdspace4art.org/)'s Open Studios event. The title is taken from [a poem by Clint Smith](https://www.clintsmithiii.com/above-ground). I used both electronic processing and a pie tin placed into the tuba bell, with jingle bells placed into the tin.
