go by land ([Michelle Lou](ttp://michellelou.com), bass and electronics, Jonathan Piper, tuba and electronics) create large-scale, slowly evolving, improvisatory pieces that bring together drone, noise, and jazz idioms. We have performed at [Drone Not Drones](https://www.dronenotdrones.com/), [High Desert Soundings](https://highdesertsoundings.com/), UC San Diego's Music Department, and more.
