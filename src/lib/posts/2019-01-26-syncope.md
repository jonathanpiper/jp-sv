[Codex Confiteor](https://confiteor.cc), my project with [Meghann Welsh](https://www.meghannwelsh.com/), draws from our shared interest in historical musical practices and religious ritual and our individual experiences with doom metal, noise, opera, and more. We debuted the project in 2018 as part of [Stay Strange](https://staystrange.com/)'s Hand of God event, held in the North Chapel at Liberty Station. For this album, we drew on the music of the Comtessa de Dia and Guillame de Machaut to explore themes of dissolution, ecstasy, and -- naturally -- syncope of the self and the other.
