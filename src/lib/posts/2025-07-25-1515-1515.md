The debut release from 1515, from Matraca Tapes. 

1515 is a collaborative duo of Jonathan Piper and Ryan Ebaugh. They incorporate extended techniques and idiosyncratic approaches to their instruments in a fresh blend of spontaneous interaction, skill, and innovation.

Jonathan Piper is a San Diego-based tubist and technologist. His work as a tubist centers on the exploration of sonic and gestural possibilities found at the limits of both the instrument and the performing body. Supported by extended techniques and live electronic processing, he combines elements of drone, doom, noise, free jazz, and contemporary idioms.

Ryan Ebaugh is a San Diego-based saxophonist known for his intense playing and experimental improvisation. Creating immersive, raw soundscapes, driven by fearless improvisation. Playing all over the country, both solo & with others. Ryan's latest release, *619-99* on Daft Alliance, captures his bold approach to spontaneous composition with a sonic exploration.
