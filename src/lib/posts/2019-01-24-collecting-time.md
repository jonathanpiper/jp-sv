**Opened:** 24 January, 2019

**Closed:** 27 January, 2019

**Purpose:** Prompting visitors to consider the role that physical media play as markers of temporal duration.

**Content:** This exhibition featured a small collection of music boxes, phonographs, and player piano rolls.

**Setting:** Housed in the Museum of Making Music's booth at the 2019 NAMM Show, this display was necessarily compact (owing to limited floorspace) and utilitarian (due to our reliance on standard trade show structural components).

**Roles:** Conception, script writing, object selection, installation.
